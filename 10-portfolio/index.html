      <h3>If you prefer summaries</h3>
      <p>A self-taught engineer from non-traditional background.</p>
      <h3>If you prefer prose</h3>
      <p>I started a tech support job so I could continue my college education. Customer support was hard but I loved untangling defects and that got the attention of a few people on our engineering team. They helped me up into quality assurance. I learned browser automation and pair programmed, was promoted to SDET. New project, new role: associate software engineer. I continue to grow and learn in the software engineering role, thriving on web dev somewhere between front-end and full-stack.</p>
      <h3>If you prefer the person</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm a Virgo, my favorite color is blue. I'd rather be gardening, bicycling, or running on a trail. Please feed me macaroni and cheese.</p>
